#+TITLE: emacs-input-display

This repository will contain a basic input display meant for enhancing streams
using Emacs.

The name is initial for now.

* Things to do

** TODO come up with a better name
The current one doesn't have a nice ring to it, and contains the word Emacs,
which would be a redundant word in a feature name.

** TODO make sure I have proper copyright headers and package ones
I want to be able to install this with my package manager (straight).
